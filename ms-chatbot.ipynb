Continuity Management\\nCorex have opted to deploy their SAP estate in a single region with no dedicated resource in a DR region to help control costs. To add resilience to some of their production systems including DNS servers, VMs are deployed in different Availability Zones in the North Europe Azure region.\\n\\nThe use of Availability Zones provides increased availability and automated DR capability within an individual region. In the unlikely event of a loss of the Primary Azure Region, new infrastructure would be created in the secondary region, and systems would be recovered from backup.\\n\\nThe primary Azure region is North Europe (Ireland). In the event of a regional outage, the infrastructure would be rebuilt in West Europe, located in Amsterdam.\\n\\nFailover is between cluster nodes.\\n\\n3.2.8. Backup & Recovery\\nCorex have chosen to utilize Azure Backup for specific backup requirements:\\n- Virtual Machine Backup: Corex leverages Azure Backup to perform regular backups of their virtual machines (VMs). This ensures that critical data, configurations, and applications within the VMs are protected, and allows for efficient restoration in case of data loss or system failures.\\n- SAP HANA Backup: For their SAP HANA deployment, Corex utilizes Azure Backup to perform backups of their SAP HANA databases. This helps protect essential data within the SAP HANA environment and enables efficient recovery, ensuring data integrity and minimising downtime.\\n- Azure Storage Blob Backup: Corex also utilizes Azure Backup for backing up their Azure Storage Blob containers. This allows them to safeguard important data stored within these containers, such as files, objects, or other resources, and facilitates easy restoration when needed.\\n\\nSince Azure Backup does not provide native support for backing up NFS file shares in Azure Files, SoftwareONE has adopted restic as a solution to address this limitation. With restic and a custom script written by SoftwareONE, NFS file shares in Azure Files are backed up in Azure storage accounts. To ensure comprehensive data protection, the Azure storage accounts, including the restic backups, are then backed up by Azure Backup in its recovery services vault. This combination of restic and Azure Backup allows SoftwareONE to effectively safeguard the NFS file shares, providing an extra layer of backup and recovery capabilities within the Azure ecosystem.\\n\\nBackup Policies:\\n- Corex's virtual machine backup policy includes daily backups at 1:00 AM UTC, with instant recovery snapshots retained for 2 days. Daily backups are stored for 7 days, while weekly backups on Sundays at 1:00 AM are retained for 3 weeks. Monthly backups occur on the first Sunday at 1:00 AM and are kept for 12 months, and yearly backups in January on the first Sunday at 1:00 AM are retained for 5 years.\\n- For HANA backups, the frequency is set to daily at 1:00 AM UTC.

      "The provided documents do not specify the exact number of system copies that are in scope for BSW. However, they do mention the following relevant points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **System Management Activities**:\n",
      "   - The documents outline various activities related to system management, including local client creation, copies, and deletes as part of Basis operations management.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Local Client Copies**:\n",

      "   - There is mention of \"1x Production to Pre-Production system refresh per annum\" which indicates that at least one system copy is planned annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Local Client Copies**:\n",
      "   - Local client copies are scheduled as required, but the strategy for these copies is to be defined as part of the service transition. This implies that additional copies may be created, but the exact number is not specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **General Operations**:\n",
      "   - The documents outline various operational activities related to SAP systems, but they do not quantify the total number of system copies beyond the mentioned refresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, based on the available information, there is at least **one system copy (refresh)** planned annually, but the total number of system copies in scope for BSW is not explicitly defined in the documents.Thinking...\n",
      "1. **Scope of System Copies in BSW**:\n",
      "   - System copies are included in the scope of BSW's Managed Services.\n",

      "   - **Local Client Copies**:\n",
      "     - Scheduled as required, with the strategy to be defined as part of the service transition.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Number of System Copies**:\n",
      "   - The documents do not specify an exact number of system copies that are in scope beyond the annual refresh and local copies as needed. The management of these copies will depend on the defined strategy during the service transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional Information**:\n",
      "   - The management of interfaces and any new PI interfaces will require scoping and pricing, indicating that additional copies or configurations may incur extra costs and need to be defined clearly.\n",
